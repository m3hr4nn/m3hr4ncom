# m3hr4ncom

Welcome to my personal website repository.

This project serves as a portfolio to showcase my experience, skills, and projects as a DevOps and Cloud Engineer. Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, the site is designed to be fast, minimal, and content-focused.

## 🔧 What’s Included

- 📄 Static home page with personal info and featured posts
- 📝 Blog posts covering DevOps, cloud computing, and automation
- 🛠️ Tools page (coming soon) with:
  - Jalali ↔ Gregorian date converter (pure JavaScript)
  - AI news feed (Python-secured API)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Hugo + PaperMod theme
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- Deployment to a Linux web host via cPanel (automated updates planned)
